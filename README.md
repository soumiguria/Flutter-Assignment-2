# Webtoon Explorer App

Welcome to the **Webtoon Explorer App**! This Flutter-based mobile application allows users to browse popular webtoon categories, view detailed information about each webtoon, save their favorites, and rate their favorite webtoons. The app is fully equipped with persistent storage for user favorites and ratings using Flutter's SharedPreferences package, ensuring that user data is stored locally across sessions.

## Features

### 1. **Home Screen: Browse Webtoon Categories**
   - Displays a list of top webtoon categories inspired by "Top 10 Popular Webtoons with Over 50 Million Views".
   - Each category includes a **title** and a **thumbnail image**.
   - Categories are listed dynamically and visually, making it easy for users to explore various webtoons.

### 2. **Detail Screen: Webtoon Information**
   - Upon selecting a category, users are navigated to the detail screen of a specific webtoon.
   - Example webtoon: **"Lore Olympus Webtoon: Jaw Dropping Seen on Media"**.
   - This screen includes:
     - A high-quality image of the webtoon.
     - A brief description.
     - A button to add the webtoon to **Favorites**.
   - Users can rate the webtoon using a 1-5 star rating system, with the rating stored locally.

### 3. **Favorites Screen: Manage Favorite Webtoons**
   - Users can view their saved favorite webtoons.
   - Favorites are stored locally using Flutter's **SharedPreferences** package, ensuring persistence across app restarts.
   - Users can view each webtoonâ€™s details or remove them from favorites.

### 4. **Rating Feature**
   - Users can rate their favorite webtoons with a **1 to 5-star rating** system.
   - The app dynamically calculates and displays the **average rating** on the detail screen.
   - The user's rating and the average rating are both stored locally using SharedPreferences.
