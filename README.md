# Webtoon Explorer App

Welcome to the **Webtoon Explorer App**! This Flutter-based mobile application allows users to browse popular webtoon categories, view detailed information about each webtoon, save their favorites, and rate their favorite webtoons. The app is fully equipped with persistent storage for user favorites and ratings using Flutter's SharedPreferences package, ensuring that user data is stored locally across sessions.

## Features

   - Categories are listed dynamically and visually, making it easy for users to explore various webtoons.

### 2. **Detail Screen: Webtoon Information**
   - Upon selecting a category, users are navigated to the detail screen of a specific webtoon.

     - A brief description.
     - A button to add the webtoon to **Favorites**.
   - Users can rate the webtoon using a 1-5 star rating system, with the rating stored locally.

### 3. **Favorites Screen: Manage Favorite Webtoons**
   - Users can view their saved favorite webtoons.
   - Favorites are stored locally using Flutter's **SharedPreferences** package, ensuring persistence across app restarts.

## How the App Works

### Detail Screen:

- Users can also rate the webtoon (1-5 stars) using the rating bar, and the rating is saved locally.

### Favorites Screen:

## Future Improvements

- **Hive Integration**: For more efficient local storage and to support storing additional metadata.
